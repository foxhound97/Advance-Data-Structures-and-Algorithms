Problem 1: To find height of a level order Binary tree.

1)Theoritical Analysis:

For N Node Level order Binary tree, the height 'h' would be (lgN+1) with time complexity of O(lgN).

2)Practical analysis using chrono:

No of nodes in Bin Tree	(N)	       Height of the tree (h)				Time taken to find it's height (in us) (T=c.lgN+k)

	1					1							0.450
	2					2							0.596
	3					2							0.619
	4					3							0.700
	5					3							0.860
	6					3							0.862
	7					3							0.870
	8					4							1.002
	9					4							1.105
	10					4							1.241

Observation & conclusion:

It's clearly being observed from the time stamps (mostly aroung input of 5,6,7 & 8,9,10) that for the input N, the outpot time varies at a very steady rate, hence following a approximately logarithmic function when plotted against N. Minor variations can be obsereved due to presence of real constants c & k.
