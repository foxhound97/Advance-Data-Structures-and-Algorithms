Problem 5: Analysing Median of 3 Quick Sort

1) Logic Used:

We copy the start, mid and last element from a random array and store it in an auxilary array. We then sort the aux array and picup the middle element, we choose that particular middle element as pivot from our random array, swap it with last elemwnt in random array and apply lumuto logic.

2) TC analysis:

T(n)=O(n) + T(n-1) + O(1) [swapping pivot with last element]

solving:

T(n) = O(n.lgn)

3) Observation table:

Mideain of 3 quick sort is applied on 10 random array each with fixed size of 1024.
