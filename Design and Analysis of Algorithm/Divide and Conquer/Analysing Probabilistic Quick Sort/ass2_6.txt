Problem 5: Analysing Probabilistic Quick Sort

1) Logic Used:

We generate a random number using rand() fucntion in c++ which will be cating as the index of pivot element in a random array which is to be sort. We select the element whose index is generated by rand() fucntion, swap it with last elemwnt in random array and apply lumuto logic.

2) TC analysis:

T(n)=O(n) + T(n-1) + O(1) [swapping pivot obtained from random indexing with last element]

solving:

T(n) = O(n.lgn)

3) Observation table:

Probabilistic quick sort is applied on 10 random array each with fixed size of 1024.
