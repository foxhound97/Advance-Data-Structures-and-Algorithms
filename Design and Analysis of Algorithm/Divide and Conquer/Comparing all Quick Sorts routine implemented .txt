Problem 7: Comapring Problem 4,5,6.

Note: all the quick sort routines - hoare, lumuto, probabilistic & Median of 3 gives TC in O(n.lgn).

Observation Table:

4 different vectors of same size is being alloted to each quick sort routine. The size of vectors are varied to obtained unique observations.

Input 		Hoare partition		Lumuto partition		Median of three partition	Random partition

10			3			2			5				7
100			40			38			83				92
1000			496			768			1007				856
10000			4528			28356			29875				26587


Conclusion: For a random array, Hoare partition is best suited as it consumes less time, reason being the number of swaps is less in it.
